/**
 * Best-effort "relaunch this JVM" for the Desktop language-change
 * flow. In `jpackage`-built installers (DMG/MSI/DEB) the current
 * process's command line is a clean invocation of the app launcher,
 * and [ProcessHandle] reliably gives us the executable path plus the
 * original arguments — `ProcessBuilder` can spawn a fresh instance
 * from that and we just exit this one. From IDE runs / `./gradlew
 * run` the command line reflects the Gradle-managed forked JVM,
 * which may or may not relaunch cleanly depending on classpath and
 * stdout wiring; if the spawn fails we still want to exit so the
 * user can reopen manually rather than be stuck in a half-applied
 * state.
 *
 * [inheritIO] so the relaunched process shares our stdin/stdout/
 * stderr — mostly relevant in terminal runs; packaged apps have no
 * attached terminal so it's a no-op there.
